# What I do

I am a self taught graphic designer and developer. My well-known fields are: Game developement (Unity C#), 3D Modelling (Blender), UI/UX, Logo Creation and Vector Art (Inkscape). I can also design and create concept art and bring it to life with websites or 3D Models.

# Background

From my childhood I always loved art in general, but Vector Art stood out the most. The concept of manipulating simple shapes and objects to create a big detailed piece of art sounded very intriguing to me. I knew that graphic design is something I want to explore in the future.

About 1.5 years ago I started my dream game project <a class="page-link" href="https://metapikachu.itch.io/robosamurai">RoboSamurai</a>. Game developement requires a lot of hard work and knowledge. I already had experience with UI design, but adding an additional dimention to my work seemed unreal. Then I learnt about Blender. I fell in love with the program and decided to learn it and use it to my advantage.
